# Swisstopo for Garmin watches

Pre-built Custom Maps (KMZ) packs of Switzerland for the **Epix 2 / Epix Pro / Fenix 7 Pro / Fenix 8** family. Open-source Swisstopo data, packaged so it fits inside the watch's firmware tile cap.

## Get started

- **[Install guide](https://joepvde.github.io/garminswisstopo-public/install.html)** - step-by-step, beginner-friendly.
- **[GPX picker](https://joepvde.github.io/garminswisstopo-public/gpx_pack_picker.html)** - drop a GPX, get download links for the right zones.
- **[Tile picker](https://joepvde.github.io/garminswisstopo-public/tile_picker.html)** - paint your own area or auto-select from a tour GPX, then either download the touching pre-built zones or request a custom build (5 builds/email/month).

Browse pre-built downloads under [Releases](../../releases).

## Routable vector map (fenix 9 Pro, Edge 1050)

- **[Routable map builder + install guide](https://joepvde.github.io/garminswisstopo-public/routable.html)**: whole-Switzerland `.img` (prebuilt, ~300 MB) or a custom area build kit. Turn-by-turn routing and address search on the device; no tile cap; no hillshading or trail overlay.
- Pipeline and review notes: [docs/ROUTABLE.md](docs/ROUTABLE.md).

## What you get on the watch

Either:

- **Winter ski-touring**: LK25 Winter raster (Swisstopo) + 4-class slope shading + SAC ski tours coloured by difficulty (blue / red / black).
- **Summer hiking**: LK25 Summer raster + slope shading + Wanderwege coloured by category (yellow / red / blue for Wanderweg / Bergwanderweg / Alpinwanderweg).

## Slope shading is advisory only

Derived from the swissALTI3D 10 m DEM. Class boundaries follow the official SLF `ch.swisstopo.hangneigung-ueber_30` product, but no warranty is given for any individual pixel. **The slope overlay does NOT replace the daily SLF avalanche bulletin or on-site judgement.** Use at your own risk; backcountry skiing has inherent risks including death.
